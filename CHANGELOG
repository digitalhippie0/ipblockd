-- ToDo:

[ ]	document tools/*
[ ]	add a PID file to avoid ipblockd running more than once
[ ]	generalize/minimize ASN lookups (try: geoip ...)


-- Done:

- v1.0.5

[x]	statistics have sorted output now

- v1.0.4

[x]	logging: add log levels (info, warn, err) if possible
	journalctl now shows some pretty coloring :-)
[x]	add new entries, new hosts and many more counters to statistics output
[x]	make volatile stats counters persistent
[-]	include documentation from .defaults file into README.md
	README.md and INSTALL.md both contain a hint to the documentation within the file itself.
	this is much easier to maintain.

- v1.0.3

[x]	add "never" networks (eg. RFC private, localhost & my own), log events
[x]	limit netmasks to be >=8 for safety, log events
[x]	rewrite README.md
[x]	write an INSTALL.md

- v1.0.2ÃŸ

[x]	add individual hosts count to stats output
[x]	RegEx matching should now ignore these pesky DNS records containing reversed IP addresses
[x]	review RegEx matching in case we have more than one IP per line
[x]	fix service file (ENV has been lost)

- v1.0.1

[x]	create tools directory, copy ipset_saver
[x]	fix repos for ipblockd
[x]	change name from ipset_blocker to ipblockd
[x]	create share directory, move .service .defaults and .rsyslog.conf files
[x]	add the lsipsets function as a script
[x]	fix typo in stats output
[x]	change comments to not include ".. (IPSET_BASE) .."
[x]	change comments to start with '@TIMESTAMP' rather than '#TIMESTAMP' 
[x]	logging: do not start with '# '
[x]	make pipe closer more secure (ie. add an UUID to trigger)
[x]	create new ipsets with timeout set to maximum possible (2147483)
[x]	properly reference GNU/GPL in the scripts
[x]	rewrite config files to match new name
